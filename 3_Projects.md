#Generative Design of a Quadcopter 

Intially I started with the design criteria of an drone which require set of goals and the requirments.  We should choose the multirotor parts - Chassis, motors, battery, flight controller, propeller, ESC, PDB, controller and receiver, sensors. Factors such as flight time, thrust ratio, overall weight, propeller size, battery configuration, motor should be studied

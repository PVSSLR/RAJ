 # Other Experience 
 
 ## Short Course on remote sensing and image analysis
  
I was amoung 40 students to attend a two month short course on remote sensing and image analysis which was conducted by Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Indian Space Research Organization, Dehradun, India. The main objective of this programme is to train and improve the capacity of working professionals, researchers and students in the field of remote sensing with special emphasis on processing of remotely sensed data using digital image processing techniques.

 The course consist of three section which are Basics of Remote sensing and Photogrammetry, Digital Image Analysis and finally a project  work. During this period, I was able to gain both theoritical and practical knowledge in field of Remote sensing and image analysis. I was also able to network with researchers and working professionals from 15+ countries.
